Delete tag <del> - A line will be created through the text.
Insert tag <ins> - It puts new text in place of the <del></del> tag items (honestly this tag is somewhat useless for me).
Block of quote <blockquote> - Created a block of quote i.e. helps writing paragraphs of quotes (changes the format a bit)
Quote <q> - Writes a one liner quote

*NOTE* - <blockquote> and <q> are not quite diffirent honestly, unless you use the cite attribute with <blockquote> which is a very in-depth concept.

Address <address> - Creates a different format style for mentioning an address.
